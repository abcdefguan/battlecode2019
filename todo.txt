Todo
- Determine map symmetries automatically
- Build 10 knights (move out of the way when full)
- Rally knights to move to enemy castles and attack them
- Announce that a castle has been destroyed and act accordingly, check if a castle has been destroyed, do micro move
- Add code for knights to micro
- Move to guanplayer2
- Get first pilgrim to harvest from richest deposit first
- Update micro code to improve knight micro

Weaknesses
- Fails if enemy builds church => Need to scout for it, broadcast then add churches to list of enemies

Improvements
- Send crusaders to go fight enemy’s pilgrims
- Knowledge of all friendly castles
- Assign scouting targets if no targets

Impt
- Update clustering to use castles as centroids and assign as such
- Get workers working
- Use non clustering approach (Greedy with signalling)
- Test single base vs split base, workers vs no workers, clustering vs no clustering (Use nearest cluster first)
- Preachers
- Update micro code to be more powerful
- Group army units into a single bunch, signal to find all castle positions

!! - Figure out what caused the randomness
!! - Engagement => Never move into range of enemy, let enemy move into range of you
!! - Delay => Triggers for moving out
!! - Macro => Need to build only combat units when on alert, communicate alert status etc
!! - Micro => Improve micro on crusader, implement micro on pilgrim, try out new unit types, new unit comps
(Pick on lowest health unit, stay out of enemy attack range)
!! - Maps => Try out new random seeds
!! - Macro => When to build pilgrims, how many pilgrims, churches (and their value)
!! - Expand out units when all the spaces are filled up
!! - Castle Update => Update castle numbers accordingly when some castles die

Critical
Check pilgrim numbers => Could be bug
Send units to guard churches when they are being built ??
Units should go back after microing if they're not in attack mode
Fix issue with moving out
Build churches
=> Count live churches, determine where to build church
=> Have a new pilgrim mode that is to build a church
This pilgrim must wait 3 turns to get its build church order (based on Idx) and the other castle locs and communicate them to the church
Need to read live churches based on number of turns left alive and have a live countdown
?? Castles mine their own resources, church mine their resources ??
Mine resources based on need??
Tune parameters to macro harder (Instead of storing resources, go all workers then store resources later??)
Snipe enemy resources / churches
Church Defense
Use double speed when engaging (Attack mode)
Fix micro bug with prophets vs knights, investigate using knights
Crescent Moon formation => Deterministic Algo to choose assembly location, then build formation based on ID

Impt

Swarm Units instead of one by one => Be defensive until critical mass is attained then attack
=> Use another approach to alert units and to attack (attain critical mass)
=> Get units to spread out in direction facing enemy
=> Macro more (Test various extents of macro)
=> Build churches
Harvest karbonite / fuel dynamically => Harvest whichever we need the most right now (Signalling issue)
Move bit => Knight Rush => Need a counter
Need to review those games => doesn’t look natural
Balance Changes
Church Placement and clustering
Prophet Surround / Mass Micro Strats
Doing better broadcasts
Improve micro


- Build churches at centroids when appropriate
- Come up with a good build order and resource mine order
- Adjust number of pilgrims built
- Try other combat units
