Todo
- Determine map symmetries automatically
- Build 10 knights (move out of the way when full)
- Rally knights to move to enemy castles and attack them
- Announce that a castle has been destroyed and act accordingly, check if a castle has been destroyed, do micro move
- Add code for knights to micro
- Move to guanplayer2
- Get first pilgrim to harvest from richest deposit first
- Update micro code to improve knight micro

Weaknesses
- Fails if enemy builds church => Need to scout for it, broadcast then add churches to list of enemies

Improvements
- Send crusaders to go fight enemy’s pilgrims
- Knowledge of all friendly castles
- Assign scouting targets if no targets

Impt
- Update clustering to use castles as centroids and assign as such
- Get workers working
- Use non clustering approach (Greedy with signalling)
- Test single base vs split base, workers vs no workers, clustering vs no clustering (Use nearest cluster first)
- Preachers
- Update micro code to be more powerful
- Group army units into a single bunch, signal to find all castle positions

!! - Figure out what caused the randomness
!! - Engagement => Never move into range of enemy, let enemy move into range of you
!! - Delay => Triggers for moving out
!! - Macro => Need to build only combat units when on alert, communicate alert status etc
!! - Micro => Improve micro on crusader, implement micro on pilgrim, try out new unit types, new unit comps
(Pick on lowest health unit, stay out of enemy attack range)
!! - Maps => Try out new random seeds
!! - Macro => When to build pilgrims, how many pilgrims, churches (and their value)
!! - Expand out units when all the spaces are filled up
!! - Castle Update => Update castle numbers accordingly when some castles die

Critical
Check pilgrim numbers => Could be bug

Next Task
=> Pilgrims killed => Spawn combat units, treat as alert
=> Disable karbonite mining if karbonite more than 500 (Pilgrims sit on karbonite deposits)
(Have enough fuels for prophets to shoot)
=> Better army management (Clump together, have movement formation)
=> Don't replenish pilgrims mining in dangerous positions, remove deposits that are close to enemy castles
=> Move units up to defend church locations
=> Resource sniping, macro aggressiveness control
Get units to church locations in early game
Send units to guard churches when they are being built !!
Gradiented score based on distance away from enemy units
Test crusaders based on
Mine resources based on need??
Tune parameters to macro harder (Instead of storing resources, go all workers then store resources later??)
Snipe enemy resources / churches
Church Defense
Use double speed when engaging (Attack mode)
Fix micro bug with prophets vs knights, investigate using knights
Crescent Moon formation => Deterministic Algo to choose assembly location, then build formation based on ID

Tune macro parameters
=> Turn at which church is being built (Early church rush??)
=> Ratio of workers built to fighting units built
=> Sniping enemy resources / churches

Impt

Swarm Units instead of one by one => Be defensive until critical mass is attained then attack
=> Use another approach to alert units and to attack (attain critical mass)
=> Get units to spread out in direction facing enemy
=> Macro more (Test various extents of macro)
=> Build churches
Harvest karbonite / fuel dynamically => Harvest whichever we need the most right now (Signalling issue)
Move bit => Knight Rush => Need a counter
Need to review those games => doesn’t look natural
Balance Changes
Church Placement and clustering
Prophet Surround / Mass Micro Strats
Doing better broadcasts
Improve micro


- Build churches at centroids when appropriate
- Come up with a good build order and resource mine order
- Adjust number of pilgrims built
- Try other combat units
