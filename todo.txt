Todo
- Determine map symmetries automatically
- Build 10 knights (move out of the way when full)
- Rally knights to move to enemy castles and attack them
- Announce that a castle has been destroyed and act accordingly, check if a castle has been destroyed, do micro move
- Add code for knights to micro
- Move to guanplayer2
- Get first pilgrim to harvest from richest deposit first

Weaknesses
- Fails if enemy builds church => Need to scout for it, broadcast then add churches to list of enemies

Improvements
- Send crusaders to go fight enemyâ€™s pilgrims
- Knowledge of all friendly castles
- Assign scouting targets if no targets

Impt
- Update clustering to use castles as centroids and assign as such
- Get workers working
- Use non clustering approach (Greedy with signalling)
- Test single base vs split base, workers vs no workers, clustering vs no clustering (Use nearest cluster first)
- Preachers
- Update micro code to be more powerful
- Group army units into a single bunch, signal to find all castle positions

!! - Alert system => Alert nearby army units of enemies so can fight in a group
!! - Engagement => Never move into range of enemy, let enemy move into range of you
!! - Delay => Triggers for moving out
!! - Macro => Need to build only combat units when on alert, communicate alert status etc
!! - Micro => Improve micro on crusader, implement micro on pilgrim, try out new unit types, new unit comps
(Pick on lowest health unit, stay out of enemy attack range)
!! - Maps => Try out new random seeds
!! - Macro => When to build pilgrims, how many pilgrims, churches (and their value)
!! - Expand out units when all the spaces are filled up
!! - Castle Update => Update castle numbers accordingly when some castles die


- Build churches at centroids when appropriate
- Come up with a good build order and resource mine order
- Adjust number of pilgrims built
- Try other combat units
